**countingfish** is a chrome breowser extension that detects time-based attacks from websites that attackers use to steal your personal browser data. Our extension detects unusual use of timers like ```performance.now```, alerts the user, and distorts the accuracy of the attacker's timers to inhibit them from successfully analyzing your sensitive personal browser data.


bruce-fish is a demo attack website that hosts a crude random forest algorithm trained to detect what website a user has opened. Used to demonstrate our extension in action.
